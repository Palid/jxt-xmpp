# JXT-XMPP

This is a collection of [JXT (JSON/XML translator)](https://github.com/otalk/jxt) definitions for [XMPP](http://xmpp.org).

These definitions were originally part of the [Stanza.io](https://stanza.io) XMPP library, but have been split off into their own module so that they can be used with other projects (such as the [node-xmpp](http://node-xmpp.org) family of libraries).
